<h1>Currency Converter Project</h1>
<p>This project was quite fun and challenging for me! Especially the JavaScript part.
<br>
It was an idea from the DevClub course, but I ended up doing some customizations in the CSS on my own.
<br>
Using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
<br>
Currency Converter was a project where JavaScript started to make sense in my head!</p>
